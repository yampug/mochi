## What is Mochi?

Mochi brings modern web development to Ruby by leveraging the excellent work from [Opal](https://opalrb.com/) and tighly coupling it with the open [Web Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components) standard.

The project is still very early on its journey, so proceed at your own risk for now.
