Mochi is web framework aimed at bringing Ruby to the modern web.
Under the hood Mochi leverages [Web Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components)
& [Opal](https://opalrb.com/) to make this possible.

The project is still very early on its journey, so be cautious but eventually it should be able to underpin big web projects.

## Getting Started

### Compiling your component
